# /spec-kitty.plan - Create Implementation Plan

**Version**: 0.11.0+

## 📍 WORKING DIRECTORY: Stay in planning repository

**IMPORTANT**: Plan works in the planning repository. NO worktrees created.

```bash
# Run from project root (same directory as /spec-kitty.specify):
# You should already be here if you just ran /spec-kitty.specify

# Creates:
# - kitty-specs/###-feature/plan.md → In planning repository
# - Commits to target branch
# - NO worktrees created
```

**Do NOT cd anywhere**. Stay in the planning repository root.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Branch Strategy Confirmation (MANDATORY)

Before asking planning questions or generating artifacts, you must make the branch contract explicit.

- Never describe the landing branch vaguely. Always name the actual branch value.
- If the user says the feature should land somewhere else, stop and resolve that before writing `plan.md`.
- You must repeat the branch contract twice during this command:
  1. immediately after parsing `setup-plan --json`
  2. again in the final report before suggesting `/spec-kitty.tasks`

## Constitution Context Bootstrap (required)

Before planning interrogation, load constitution context for this action:

```bash
spec-kitty constitution context --action plan --json
```

- If JSON `mode` is `bootstrap`, apply JSON `text` as first-run governance context and follow referenced docs as needed.
- If JSON `mode` is `compact`, continue with condensed governance context.

## Location Check (0.11.0+)

This command runs in the **planning repository**, not in a worktree.

- Resolve branch context from deterministic JSON output, not from `meta.json` inspection:
  - Run `spec-kitty agent feature setup-plan --feature <feature-slug> --json`
  - Use `current_branch`, `target_branch` / `base_branch`, and `planning_base_branch` / `merge_target_branch` (plus uppercase aliases) from that payload
  - Use `branch_matches_target` from that payload to detect branch mismatch; do not probe branch state manually inside the prompt
- Planning artifacts live in `kitty-specs/###-feature/`
- The plan template is committed to the target branch after generation

**Path reference rule:** When you mention directories or files, provide either the absolute path or a path relative to the project root (for example, `kitty-specs/<feature>/tasks/`). Never refer to a folder by name alone.

## Planning Interrogation (mandatory)

Before executing any scripts or generating artifacts you must interrogate the specification and stakeholders.

- **Scope proportionality (CRITICAL)**: FIRST, assess the feature's complexity from the spec:
  - **Trivial/Test Features** (hello world, simple static pages, basic demos): Ask 1-2 questions maximum about tech stack preference, then proceed with sensible defaults
  - **Simple Features** (small components, minor API additions): Ask 2-3 questions about tech choices and constraints
  - **Complex Features** (new subsystems, multi-component features): Ask 3-5 questions covering architecture, NFRs, integrations
  - **Platform/Critical Features** (core infrastructure, security, payments): Full interrogation with 5+ questions

- **User signals to reduce questioning**: If the user says "use defaults", "just make it simple", "skip to implementation", "vanilla HTML/CSS/JS" - recognize these as signals to minimize planning questions and use standard approaches.

- **First response rule**:
  - For TRIVIAL features: Ask ONE tech stack question, then if answer is simple (e.g., "vanilla HTML"), proceed directly to plan generation
  - For other features: Ask a single architecture question and end with `WAITING_FOR_PLANNING_INPUT`

- If the user has not provided plan context, keep interrogating with one question at a time.

- **Conversational cadence**: After each reply, assess if you have SUFFICIENT context for this feature's scope. For trivial features, knowing the basic stack is enough. Only continue if critical unknowns remain.

Planning requirements (scale to complexity):

1. Maintain a **Planning Questions** table internally covering questions appropriate to the feature's complexity (1-2 for trivial, up to 5+ for platform-level). Track columns `#`, `Question`, `Why it matters`, and `Current insight`. Do **not** render this table to the user.
2. For trivial features, standard practices are acceptable (vanilla HTML, simple file structure, no build tools). Only probe if the user's request suggests otherwise.
3. When you have sufficient context for the scope, summarize into an **Engineering Alignment** note and confirm.
4. If user explicitly asks to skip questions or use defaults, acknowledge and proceed with best practices for that feature type.

## Outline

1. **Check planning discovery status**:
   - If any planning questions remain unanswered or the user has not confirmed the **Engineering Alignment** summary, stay in the one-question cadence, capture the user's response, update your internal table, and end with `WAITING_FOR_PLANNING_INPUT`. Do **not** surface the table. Do **not** run the setup command yet.
   - Once every planning question has a concrete answer and the alignment summary is confirmed by the user, continue.

2. **Resolve feature context deterministically** (CRITICAL - prevents wrong feature selection):
   - Prefer an explicit feature slug from user direction or from the current directory path (`kitty-specs/<feature-slug>/...`)
   - If you do not yet have an explicit feature slug, run `spec-kitty agent feature setup-plan --json` once without `--feature`
   - If that call succeeds, treat its JSON as the canonical setup payload and skip step 3
   - If that call returns an ambiguity error with `available_features`, stop and resolve one explicit feature slug before continuing

3. **Setup**: If step 2 did not already return a successful setup payload, run `spec-kitty agent feature setup-plan --feature <feature-slug> --json` from the repository root and parse JSON for:
   - `result`: "success" or error message
   - `feature_slug`: Resolved feature slug
   - `spec_file`: Absolute path to resolved spec.md
   - `plan_file`: Absolute path to the created plan.md
   - `feature_dir`: Absolute path to the feature directory
   - `current_branch`: branch checked out when planning started
   - `target_branch` / `base_branch` (deterministic branch contract for downstream commands)
   - `planning_base_branch` / `merge_target_branch`: explicit aliases for planning and merge intent
   - `branch_strategy_summary`: canonical sentence describing the branch strategy

   Before proceeding, explicitly state to the user:
   - Current branch at plan start
   - Intended planning/base branch
   - Final merge target for completed changes
   - Whether `branch_matches_target` says the current branch matches that intended target

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   # If detected feature is 020-my-feature:
   spec-kitty agent feature setup-plan --feature 020-my-feature --json
   ```

   **Error handling**: If the command fails with "Cannot detect feature" or "Multiple features found", verify your feature detection logic in step 2 and ensure you're passing the correct feature slug.

4. **Load context**: Read `spec_file` from setup-plan JSON output and `.kittify/constitution/constitution.md` if it exists. If the constitution file is missing, skip Constitution Check and note that it is absent. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

5. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template, using the validated planning answers as ground truth:
   - Update Technical Context with explicit statements from the user or discovery research; mark `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` only when the user deliberately postpones a decision
   - If a constitution exists, fill Constitution Check section from it and challenge any conflicts directly with the user. If no constitution exists, mark the section as skipped.
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified or questions remain unanswered)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (commission research to resolve every outstanding clarification)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md based on confirmed intent
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design, asking the user to resolve new gaps before proceeding

6. **STOP and report**: This command ends after Phase 1 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

   **⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT proceed to task generation!** The user must explicitly run `/spec-kitty.tasks` to generate work packages. Your job is COMPLETE after reporting the planning artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run ``
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

---

## ⛔ MANDATORY STOP POINT

**This command is COMPLETE after generating planning artifacts.**

After reporting:
- `plan.md` path
- `research.md` path (if generated)
- `data-model.md` path (if generated)
- `contracts/` contents (if generated)
- Agent context file updated

**YOU MUST STOP HERE.**

Do NOT:
- ❌ Generate `tasks.md`
- ❌ Create work package (WP) files
- ❌ Create `tasks/` subdirectories
- ❌ Proceed to implementation

The user will run `/spec-kitty.tasks` when they are ready to generate work packages.

**Next suggested command**: `/spec-kitty.tasks` (user must invoke this explicitly)
